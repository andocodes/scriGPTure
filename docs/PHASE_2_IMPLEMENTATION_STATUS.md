# Phase 2 Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation status of the LLM Chat Feature based on the Phase 2 plan.

## Completed Components

1. **OpenRouter API Service** ✅
   - Created `services/openRouterService.ts` with:
     - Type definitions for API requests/responses
     - `getChatCompletionStream` function to handle streaming LLM responses
     - Error handling for API requests

2. **System Prompt Definition** ✅
   - Created `config/prompts.ts` with:
     - `SYSTEM_PROMPT` for personality and instructions
     - Error messages for API unavailability and missing keys

3. **AI Integration in Chat Screen** ✅
   - Updated `app/(drawer)/(chat)/index.tsx` to:
     - Use the OpenRouter API service
     - Handle streaming responses
     - Build context-rich prompts with Bible verses
     - Manage chat persistence and history

4. **Persistent Chat History** ✅
   - Enhanced `useMessages` hook to:
     - Support saving/loading chats with AsyncStorage
     - Generate unique chat IDs
     - Track the current active chat

5. **History Screen** ✅
   - Implemented `app/(drawer)/(chat)/history.tsx` to:
     - Display all past conversations
     - Show message previews
     - Support deleting chats
     - Navigate to existing chats

## Integration Flow

1. When a user starts a new chat, a unique chat ID is generated
2. When messages are added, they are automatically saved to AsyncStorage
3. The chat history screen shows all saved conversations
4. When a Bible verse is added as context, it's included in the prompt to the LLM
5. The LLM response is streamed in real-time to provide a responsive experience

## Next Steps

1. **Testing and Refinements**
   - Test the API integration with real OpenRouter credentials
   - Verify streaming behavior works correctly
   - Ensure chat history persistence functions as expected

2. **Potential Enhancements**
   - Add ability to rename chats for better organization
   - Implement a more robust caching strategy for large chat histories
   - Consider SQLite for larger chat storage if needed

## Note on API Keys

The app already has a secure API key management system in place using Expo SecureStore, which is integrated with the chat feature. Users will need to add their OpenRouter API key in settings to use the chat functionality.
